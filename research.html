<br><i>Under review</i>
<br>Amber Nadal and <a href="https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage.aspx?id=sah33" target="_blank">Sam Hardy</a>
<br><span id="relint-abstract" class="abstract">This research demonstrates the psychometrics and validity of a short from of the Religious Internalization Scale (a self-determination theory measure of religious motivation), and examines the role of different types of religious motivation for youth outcomes.  Participants were three samples (N = 378; N = 278; N = 275) of religious adolescents and their parents from across the U.S. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the 3-factor (external, introjected, and autonomous motivation), 15-item measure (RIS-15) was developed in one study, and confirmed in the other two. Relationships of the three factors to youth outcomes were assessed in each study using structural equation modeling.  In general, autonomous religious motivation positively predicted adaptive outcomes (e.g. prosocial behaviors, psychological well-being, and positive traits) and negatively predicted maladaptive outcomes (e.g. antisocial and health-risk behaviors, mental illness, and negative traits), whereas the inverse was largely true of external motivation, and links with introjected motivation were sparse. Further, autonomous religious motivation often remained predictive of outcomes in the context of other aspects of religiousness. Lastly, autonomous religious motivation and religious involvement interacted in many cases when predicting youth outcomes.  The findings validate the RIS-15 and elucidate the importance of autonomous religious motivation.</span>

<p><a href="#equality-abstract"><b>Quality Equality: The Slow Emergence of Deep Fairness Concerns</b></a>
<br><i>Under review</i>
<br><a href="http://www.marksheskin.com/" target="_blank">Mark Sheskin</a>, Amber Nadal, <a href="http://adamcroom.me/" target="_blank">Adam Croom</a>, Tanya Mayer, Jenny Nissel, and <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~pb85/Paul_Bloom.html"target="_blank">Paul Bloom</a>
<br><span id="equality-abstract" class="abstract">From 3 to 10 years old, children become more generous when allocating  resources between self and other, eventually providing equal numbers for each person. We investigate whether children who act fairly according to "numerical equality" are likewise committed to "quality equality." We find that, although children will typically split four toys "two each" by age 6, they continue to take an unfair advantage in toy quality. It is not until around age 10 that children provide equal quality toys to each person. Specifically, 6- to 8-year-olds typically take two high-value toys and provide two low-value toys to the other child, whereas 9- and 10-year-olds provide one high-value and one low-value toy per person. In a follow-up study, we use a third-person situation to confirm that 6- to 8-year-olds understand that fairness requires quality equality, and hence appreciate that their own choices are unfair.</span>

<p><a href="#religspirit-abstract"><b>Understanding the Roles of Religiosity and Spirituality in Emerging Adulthood</b></a>
<br><i>In preparation</i>
<br>Amber Nadal and <a href="https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage.aspx?id=sah33" target="_blank">Sam Hardy</a>
<br><span id="religspirit-abstract" class="abstract">The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence and adaptiveness of patterns of religiosity and spirituality among emerging adults. Our sample of 9,495 college students (ages ranged from 18-25, M age = 19.77; 73% female; 62% European American; 34% were Protestant, 27% Roman Catholic, and 21% no affiliation) came from the Multi-Site University Study of Identity and Culture (MUSIC; see Castillo and Schwartz 2013). The study consisted of a cross-sectional survey design. We used both a variable-centered approach and a person-centered approach (latent profile analysis) to compare styles of religiosity and spirituality on outcomes. Using the variable centered approach, we find that individuals who are Both Religious and Spiritual fare the best in terms of outcomes. Individuals who are Spiritual but not Religious and Neither Religious nor Spiritual tended to have better outcomes than those who are Religious but not Spiritual. Using the person-centered approach, we find that High Religiosity and Spirituality individuals have the best outcomes, followed by Low Religiosity and Spirituality. Those with Moderate Religiosity and Spirituality tended to do more poorly. Implications for religious and spiritual profiles are discussed.</span>

<p><b><a href="#VIRS-abstract">What a Eudaimonic Perspective Can Add to the Understanding of Marital Quality: Incremental Validity of Virtue in Relationships </a></b>
<br><i>In preparation</i>
<br>Amber Nadal, <a href="https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage.aspx?id=sah33" target="_blank">Sam Hardy</a>, <a href="https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage.aspx?id=srb37" target="_blank">Scott Braithwaite</a>, and <a href="http://brentslife.com/" target="_blank">Brent Slife</a>
<br><span id="VIRS-abstract" class="abstract">The present study conceptualized marital quality from a eudaimonic, relational-virtues oriented perspective. The Virtue in Relationships Scale (VIRS; comprised of empathy, forgiveness, gratitude, humility, and trust subscales) was created through culling important marital themes, and psychometrics and validity were assessed relative to pre-existing hedonic measures of marital quality (Quality of Marriage Index and marital satisfaction). In multiple regression analyses the VIRS was a strong predictor of several marital outcomes (relational support and depth, relationship self-regulation strategies and effort, relationship security, reconsideration of commitment, and negative conflict tactics), controlling for pre-existing measures of marital quality and length of marriage. Evidence of the incremental validity of the VIRS over the QMI and marital satisfaction is provided.</span>
