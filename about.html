		<p>Welcome! I am originally from Orange County, California. I attended <a href="http://www.pointloma.edu/" target="_blank">Point Loma Nazarene University</a> in San Diego, CA as an undergraduate, where I earned a B.A. in Therapeutic and Community Psychology. Currently, I am a third-year Social Psychology doctoral student at <a href="http://home.byu.edu/home/" target="_blank">Brigham Young University</a> in Provo, Utah where I work closely with my advisor, <a href="https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/FacultyPage.aspx?id=sah33" target="_blank">Sam Hardy</a>. </p>  
<p>Over the last several years, I have become increasingly interested in topics at the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and morality. At BYU, my research focuses on virtues, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_phenomenon" target="_blank">Michelangelo phenomenon</a>, and moral identity. For more information, please visit my research page. </p>
<p>When I am not doing research, I like to rock climb, rollerblade, and have theoretical conversations (mostly about metaphysics and morality). I also like to travel, and am lucky enough to have been to over 20 countries. </p>
 <p>Please feel free to email me if you have any questions about my research, teaching, or tutorials! </p>
