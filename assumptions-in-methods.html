		<p><b>Assumptions Behind Research Methods</b></p>
		<p></p>Below are just five of the categories of assumptions that have a drastic effect on the way a person conducts research. These assumptions are relatively under-discussed. Too often, scientific research is touted for its "objectivity." This is simply not the case. Science, like other ways of knowing, adopts and lives by a number of biases. These biases tend to become reified, and thus overlooked. But if science is to truly be objective, then methods that stem from these various assumptions ought to be considered equally.* After all, there is no scientific evidence, and cannot be scientific evidence to support any one of these assumptions.</p>
		<p>Even if one does not acknowledge and actively consider these assumptions, you cannot escape them. I believe it is better, then, to at least consider your assumptions, and to make them apparent in your own interpretations of data. Although each of these explanations is elementary (and don't do justice to the nuances involved), I hope you find the explanations of the assumptions, as well as their implications for conducting research, relevant and fruitful.</p>
