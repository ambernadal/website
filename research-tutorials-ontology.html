		<p><b>Ontological Assumptions of Research</b></p>
		<p>Ontology addresses the question, what form of being is most fundamental? That is, what is the nature of reality?</p>
		<p>Abstractionism is the ontology that most Western thinkers are used to--particularly given the individualistic nature of Western society. Ultimately, abstractionism holds that things (and people) are self-contained objects. An abstractionist thinker believes things are most real or best understood without a context--as an isolated substance.</p>
		<p>This has given rise to the laboratory tradition that is so common in psychological research. The thought is, if I really want to know how person X responds to stimulus Y, I need to eliminate other every possible confounding variable. Abstractionists invite participants into controlled, sterile laboratory environments, because confounding variables are assumed to be a threat to construct validity.</p>

			</div>
		<p>We also see abstractionism as an underlying assumption in reductionist research methods. For example, much of psychology today is now turning towards neuroscience for answers about what causes behavior. Rather than focusing on the holistic social world, abstractionists look at one human, and how their brain activity dictates behavior. From there, they may look at how a network of neurons produces behavior, and then how one small set of neurons relates to behavior, and they are likely continue zooming into what are thought to be even more fundamental units of understanding.</p>
		<p>A relational ontology, on the other hand, assumes that contexts and things mutually constitute one another. A human, then is best thought of not as an individual with relationships, but rather as a nexus of relationships. As context is removed, so is the ability to understand the nexus of relationships at hand.</p>

				<small><em>In the figure above, the black box represents the scope that a relational researcher would find more appropriate for gaining knowledge about person X. </em></small>
			</div>
		<p>Unlike abstractionism, this ontology lends itself to naturalistic (and often qualitative) data collection. The idea is if you want to understand how person X responds to stimulus Y, you need to see how they operate among the other variables they encounter in the world. Confounding variables are less of a concern (and in fact they ought to be capitalized on), because the presence of those other naturally-occurring variables bolsters generalizability.</p>
		<p>But a strong relational ontology would go one step further and claim that it would be impossible to totally isolate a thing or person (as abstractionism assumes) anyway. A person or an object has meaning only when it is in relationship with other things. For instance, we can only recognize one participant as depressed if we hold them in relation to another person or another standard to which we compare.</p>
